# Simple Shell

**Description:**
 A shell in it's most basic form meant to mimic an UNIX/POSIX shell. Think of it as a baby bash.

**Purpose:**
This shell will have limited functionality and serves the purpose of show casing what students 3 months into C language can do and aspire to. It's both a gauge and a motivator to those who are doing it or who may come after us. We do not intend to replace any of the excellent shell options already available. We only intend to grasp a better understanding of C and the things built on C.

## Prerequisites
As of this writing those are still in flux and subject to change. So far they are listed as needing a Compiler with the proper .h files included in the library of function calls. an X86 system with 2GB minimum of system memory. The progam itself is not resource intensive but can run on anything from a Windows OS, Linux distro, or Mac OS. ARM architecture maybe used as well.

## Installation
Fairly straightforward, download the requisite files from Github, compile and run.

## Usage
The shell is simplistic, with expected functionalites such as:
- Executing programs
- System calls: getpid, pwd, open, opendir, kill, close, closedir, chdir, exit.
