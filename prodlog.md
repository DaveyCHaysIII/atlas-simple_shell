Davey 3/20:
Got a lot of research done on fork(), execve(), PID and basic shell loop
Davey 3/21: 
Got further research done, started super simple shell (see testing), created repo
3/23 Chase and Davey met in Assembly 10 am-12pm:
Talked about expectations, parsed up workload got the flow of the shell laid out.

Chase 3/23:
working in repo intermittently on getting a flow chart set up and uploaded.
Flow Chart will require more research than expected but I believe a solid, not finished, README has been accomplished.
